## Description

Welcome to Spirits & Spirits the ultimate site to start or end your day. Ever wonder what your tarot says? Join us in pulling a tarot card for your daily reading. A drink recommendation is also included and all you will need to do is decide weather it will be an alcoholic or not.

## Problem Domain

Do you question if the universe is trying to tell you something? Do you want to take some time with a drink and mull it over? Welsome to our App.

A leisure oriented application meant for a user to perform a simple tarot reading and self reflect upon it alongside drinks for the day.

Stretch goals are to save the history of a drink and attach it to music recommendations based on the tarot card drawn name.
